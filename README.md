### You can always count on me when you need help with some tech, brute force, or just an ear to listen.

With my past work experience, I have polished my skill to adapt to any new working structure that I encounter.
I can listen to the problem and muster a solution that will statisfy all sides.

### A funny story

The morning I turned 18, I decided to shave my head. And I did it before sitting down for breakfast. The shock of the family was not that bad, but as soon as I arrived to school, the principal send me to see the psychologist for fear of a mental breakdown.
