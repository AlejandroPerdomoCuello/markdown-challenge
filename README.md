    <h3>You can always count on me when...</h3>
    <p>With my past work experience, I have polished my skill to adapt to any new working structure that I encounter. <br />
    My best qualities are the ease with I can listen to a problem and find a solution that best fits what the customer, or teammates, feel comfortable with. I will also tackel any problem with no fear of what the solution will be.</p>

    <h3>A funny story</h3>
    <p>The morning I turned 18, I decided to shave my head. And I did it before sitting down for breakfast. The shock of the family was not that bad, but as soon as I arrived to school, the principal send me to see the psychologist for fear of a mental breakdown.</p>
